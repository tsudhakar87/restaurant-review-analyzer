FILE PHOTO: An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California October 21, 2013. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo \nXgeva has already been approved to treat a condition in which the calcium level in blood is above normal and giant cell tumor of the bone. \nAmgen reacquired sales rights to Xgeva along with two other drugs from British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline in 2015.( reut.rs/2F43mf5 ) \nThe deal gave the drugmaker rights to sell in 48 countries, including Australia as well as markets in Asia, South America and Europe. \nXgeva is one of Amgen’s key growth drivers and had raked in $1.53 billion in sales in 2016.
